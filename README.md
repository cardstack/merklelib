You can also export the output above as an image. This is how you'd do it:


```python
 from merkle import MerkleTree, export


 transactions = get_transactions(user) # random data
 tree = MerkleTree(transactions)

 export(tree, filename='transactions', ext='jpg')
```

Default extension is always `.png`. You can also specify an absolute path.

However, in order to be able to use the `export` function, you may need to install `graphviz` on your machine.
Here is how you can do that for Mac and Ubuntu:

### Mac

`brew install graphviz`


### Ubuntu

`sudo apt-get install graphviz`
